# VegStyle CIO 🌿🛡️

VegStyle is a non-profit Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO) dedicated to accelerating animal advocacy through accessible technology. Our mission is to provide a free, comprehensive platform for the vegan community.

## 📱 The VegStyle App

We are developing an all-in-one mobile application designed to simplify vegan activism and daily lifestyle choices:

- **Petition Hub**: A centralized place to discover, track, and sign petitions for animal rights.
- **Product Scanner**: Scan barcodes to instantly verify the vegan status of products and contribute to a shared database.
- **Ethical News & Events**: Stay updated with the latest news and find local vegan events or activism opportunities.
- **Transparent Donations**: A system to direct donations directly to verified animal sanctuaries and non-profit organizations.

## 🛠 Engineering Approach

As a tech-forward CIO, we build our tools with a focus on:
- **Zero Cost for Users**: All our tools are and will remain 100% free.
- **Data Integrity**: Using robust scanning logic and verified news sources.
- **Security**: Protecting donor information and user data through enterprise-grade infrastructure.

## 📁 Active Projects

- **.github**: Community health files and global security policies.
- *(Repositories for the mobile app and backend services will be published here as development progresses).*

## 🤝 Get Involved

We are looking for developers, UI/UX designers, and vegan advocates who want to contribute to an open-source ethical project.
